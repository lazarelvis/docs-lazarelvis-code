title: How to setup multiple Node js versions
description: Usually we we have multiple apps using diffrent versions of node and npm
---
import { Code } from 'astro-expressive-code/components'

export const curl = `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash`;
export const restart_shell = `\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"`
export const install_node = `nvm install 22`
export const verify_node = `node -v 
nvm current
`
export const change_version = `nvm use 16`


We will use Node Version Manager (nvm)
Download and install nvm:
<Code code={curl} lang="bash" />
Restarting the shell
<Code code={restart_shell} lang="bash" />
Download and install Node.js:
<Code code={install_node} lang="bash" />
Verify the Node.js version:
<Code code={verify_node} lang="bash" />
And for changing the version we use
<Code code={change_version} lang="bash" />

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.
